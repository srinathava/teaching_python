# Database Migration Notice

The database functionality has been moved to the Python backend. This directory is kept temporarily for documentation purposes and will be removed once the migration is complete and tested.

## Changes Made

1. All database operations now happen in the Python backend
2. Progress tracking uses the `/api/progress` endpoint
3. Frontend components have been updated to use the new API

## TODO

- Remove this directory once the migration is complete and tested
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
